## I'm a undergraduate software engineering

Passionate about technology and its constant innovation (ðŸš€), I am a software developer determined to deliver high-quality work. From architectural design to writing efficient, well-documented and robust code. I'm against overspecialization and that we shouldn't get attached to specific programming languages.
